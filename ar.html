							<p>For how much danger the technology allows us to avoid, augmented reality provides its own set of dangers. The enrichment that augmented reality provides comes with a cost in awareness in some cases, whether by losing distinction between what is real and not real or otherwise hampering people’s awareness in the real world</p>
							<p>One well-known example of this would be Pokémon Go; in their adventures to obtain these Pokémon, there have been many cases of people dying from things like walking off of cliffs or into minefields in pursuit of rare Pokémon. There was also for a time an increase in theft in many major cities due to people getting out at darker hours with their phones out and their awareness almost nonexistent.</p>

								<p>There are many future uses of augmented reality, from marketing to gaming. There are some online store that are developing software that allows users to try on clothing using augmented reality. This could be a game changer to the fashion industry. Augmented reality will allow us to view maps in 3d with lots of details. This will allow for better mapping of the world. Augmented reality is also making its way into gaming. One of the most popular games out now is Pokemon go, and there will be more games like this to come.  </p>
